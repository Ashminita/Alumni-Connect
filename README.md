# Alumni Network Connect - Recruitment & Achievements Sections

> âœ¨ This project also integrates code from Rajbir's `Alumini-Connect` repository.

This repository contains my completed contribution to the **Alumni Network Connect** project.  
I developed the **Recruitment** and **Achievements** sections using **ReactJS with Vite** for fast performance and modern development.

These sections are now **fully functional on the frontend** and ready for integration with the backend (MongoDB).

## Overview

### Recruitment Section
- Displays job and internship opportunities for alumni and students.
- Clean, card-based UI for listing roles.
- Dynamic component structure, ready for API integration.
- Responsive design for all screen sizes.

### Achievements Section

- Grid layout with responsive styling.
- Easily extendable to fetch data dynamically from backend.
