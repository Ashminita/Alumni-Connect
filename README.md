# Alumni Network Connect - Recruitment & Achievements Sections

This repository contains my completed contribution to the **Alumni Network Connect** project.  
I developed the **Recruitment** and **Achievements** sections using **ReactJS with Vite** for fast performance and modern development.

These sections are now **fully functional on the frontend** and ready for integration with the backend (MongoDB).

## Overview

### Recruitment Section
- Displays job and internship opportunities for alumni and students.
- Clean, card-based UI for listing roles.
- Dynamic component structure, ready for API integration.
- Responsive design for all screen sizes.

### Achievements Section
- Highlights alumni achievements (awards, recognitions, and notable contributions).
- Grid layout with responsive styling.
- Easily extendable to fetch data dynamically from backend.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** ReactJS (Vite)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (or custom CSS)
- **State Management:** React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
